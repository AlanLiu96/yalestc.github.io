  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Motivated by the strong interest among Yale students to build applications, the Student Developer Program was launched in the Fall of 2012. The program is part of ITS Campus Community Technologies (CCT), and has three core goals: teach interested students how to develop software, hire students to develop software, and support the broader student developer community.</p>

<h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>

<p>The Student Developer Program currently offers a core course in web developing with Ruby on Rails. This course is taught on a semester basis, and covers the basics of building web applications using Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Additionally, we offer a number of workshops each semester, on a variety of topics (including Ruby on Rails, iOS Development, and more).</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="employment__projects">Employment &amp; Projects</h3>

<p>We offer students the opportunity to work as Student Developers. Student Developers receive on-going training, and get paid to work on software projects related to student life, academics, and other University needs.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="community">Community</h3>

<p>We also work to support the community of students interested learning and practicing software development. In addition to our course offerings, we work with groups on-campus such as HackYale, Yale BootUp, and the YCC to host events such as the YCC App Challenge, Open Office Hours (where students can drop in to get advice or just chat about building apps), and focus groups with ITS for students to provide feedback on ITS projects.</p>
