###What is the HackSpace?###
The HackSpace is an area specifically created for developers to be able to work,
collaborate, and learn programming. The HackSpace has awesome amenities available
such as Chromecast-enabled TVs, free coffee and snacks, and dry-erase walls.


The space is available to Yale students and employees who are interested in programming
and/or are interested in working with other developers. We envision it as a community-building space to bring together creative and innovative programmers from all over the campus.
