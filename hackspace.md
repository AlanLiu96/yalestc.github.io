###What is the HackSpace?###
The HackSpace is an area specifically created for developers to be able to work,
collaborate, and learn programming. The HackSpace has awesome amenities available
such as Chromecast-enabled TVs, free coffee and snacks, and dry-erase walls.


The space is available to Yale students and employees who are interested in programming
and/or are interested in working with other developers. We envision it as a community-building space to bring together creative and innovative programmers from all over the campus.

**Hack Sessions**

We have hack sessions every Friday from 2-5pm. We encourage all of our developers to come in and work at this time, and all are welcome to join. It's a laid back and productive way to collaborate with other developers, get help on a problem you're stuck on, or just hang out with your developer friends. The hackspace is open 24/7, but this is a time when you can be sure to find a lot of other developers! 

Another of our favorite weekly hack sessions is the A100 Study Hall, held every Thursday at The Grove. For more information, see the A100 Developer Community's [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/a100-dev-community/).
