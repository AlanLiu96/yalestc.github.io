##Telecommuting Policy
- Students can work from anywhere. Most of the time it is done from the HackSpace. Generally, mor than 2/3 of development work is done from the HackSpace.

##Code Editing Workflow

###Student Developers can
 
- edit code on their own feature branches
- submit pull requests

###Team Leads can:

- merge in pull requests of proposed changes by team members
- tag releases
- deploy changes to the development server, roll back a failed deployment
- request production server deployment from Unix Systems / Infrastructure
- request help from Unix Systems / Infrastructure

###Managers can

- grant read/edit access to our public/private repositories
- do anything student developers and team leads can do

###Unix Systems / Infrastructure can:

- retrieve a database dump for debugging purposes, providing it to student developers
- use the rails console to execute ruby commands provided by Team Leads, often to fix bugs
- deploy changes to the production server, approved by Team Leads
- roll back a failed deployment.

##Pull Request Review Policy

- code changes are normally reviewed by at least 3 people (often 2 developers pair programming, and the team lead as the third person)
