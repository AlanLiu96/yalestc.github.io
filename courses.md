###STC Courses

This course is normally taught both Fall and Spring semesters. If you'd like to hear more information about next semester's course as soon as it's available, let us know in this [interest form](https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/forms/d/1qreQU3PpvtKdwFFNcOos-Qa9fMq5auvBCPgww6_DOMw/viewform).

Current information is for the Spring 2015 Course.
The Spring 2015 Course Website is located on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/yale-stc-developer-curriculum/Yalies-On-Rails-2014-Spring/wiki).

**Content:**
This course will cover the basics of building web applications using Ruby on Rails, and is ideally suited for Students who have some experience with HTML/CSS, as well as basic programming knowledge (any language). Students who don't meet these prerequisites may still apply, though you may need to do some pre-work if you want to stay up to speed with the course.

**Instructor:**
Casey Watts (Program Manager, Student Developer and Mentorship Program)

**Eligibility:**
This course is open to anyone, even people not affiliated with Yale. The course hasn't been capped in the past, but may be in a future semester. If it is capped, preference will be given to members of the Yale community and students.

No background in programming is assumed. For students who have a background in programming, bonus content/assignments will be given.

**Meeting times:**
For Spring 2015, the course will meet every Saturday from 2pm - 4:30pm, starting on Feb 1st, and ending on April 26th. Limited office hours will be held as well (times TBA). The course will include approximately 3 - 5 hours of assignments outside of class per week.

**Location:** TEAL / 17 Hillhouse

**How to Apply:**
The interest form above is different from the Application/Registration form.
Applications for Spring 2014 are closed.

**Beyond the Course:**
Students who successfully complete the course may want to apply to work for STC as a [Student Developer](http://yalestc.github.io/jobs/index.html). Student Developers continue learning web development skills, while helping the Yale community, while getting paid to do so. Interested students should talk with the instructor about this, and about 2/3 of the way through the course, they will be evaluated for this role. Opportunities are available both term-time and over the summer.
