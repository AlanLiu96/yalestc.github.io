# STC Developer Program - Projects and Project Proposals

## Current Projects

Student Developers create and maintain software that benefits the university.
Our applications primarily use Ruby on Rails, the Android SDK, and the iOS SDK.

To see a list of projects that are currently being worked on, see our
[GitHub page](https://github.com/YaleSTC/wiki/wiki/STC-Projects).

## Project Proposal

Once per semester we review which software we're supporting and creating. If you
have an idea for an application you think we should create or adopt, please let
us know!

Projects are evaluated for the following criteria:

- Impact – how the project will support the mission of the University
- Cost Effectiveness – how the value provided compares to the cost
- Feasibility – is the project appropriate for student developers, given their
limitations
- The deadline for idea submissions for this cycle is June 30, 2014.

The idea application is here:
