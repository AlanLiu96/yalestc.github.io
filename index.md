###About

Motivated by the strong interest among Yale students to build applications, the
Student Developer Program was launched in the Fall of 2012. The program is part
of ITS Campus Community Technologies (CCT), and has three core goals: teach
interested students how to develop software, hire students to develop software,
and support the broader student developer community.

###Teaching

The Student Developer Program currently offers a number of workshops each semester,
on a variety of topics (including Android Development, iOS Development, and more).

- [More about the Workshops](courses.html)

###Employment & Projects

We offer students the opportunity to work as Student Developers. Student
Developers receive on-going training, and get paid to work on software projects
related to student life, academics, and other University needs.

###Community

We also work to support the community of students interested in learning and
practicing software development. In addition to our course offerings, we work
with groups on-campus such as HackYale, Yale BootUp, and the YCC to host events
such as the YCC App Challenge. We also hold open office hours (where students
can drop in to get advice or just chat about building apps), and focus groups
with ITS for students to provide feedback on ITS projects.

2014. We were formerly part of the [Student Technology Collaborative](http://www.yale.edu/stc), now we are
