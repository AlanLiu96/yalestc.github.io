This page gives an overview of the different roles that exist. Also see: [How to Apply](/apply.md).

The Student Developer Program operates in two main wings\: software development, and teaching. Student positions are available in both departments. All student employees report to Casey Watts and Jemin Lee at [dev-mgt@yale.edu](mailto:dev-mgt@yale.edu).


## Software Development
Development is split into teams, each comprised of developers, a technical lead, and a project manager (i.e., five per team). There are teams for Ruby on Rails, iOS, and Android app development.

### Project Manager
The Project Manager in a team is primarily responsible for meeting with clients, determining and triaging clients' needs and concerns, and coordinating testing of new releases. The Project Manager is also responsible for communicating clients' needs to the rest of the team, and working with the Technical Lead to lead team meetings. The Project Manager should have a basic understanding of the team code in order to answer clients' questions on usage and work with the Technical Lead to provide realistic expectations for feature requests.

### Technical Lead
The Technical Lead is responsible for determining the feasibility of implementing changes, and coordinating work within the team. The Technical Lead should serve as the first point of technical reference for team members, when questions arise. The Technical Lead is also responsible for managing pull requests and keeping the code in a functional state, and (for Rails teams) will be trained how to deploy new instances of the application for new clients.

* **Technical Leads** are normally promoted from Developers

### Developers
Developers work under the Technical Lead and Project Manager and are responsible for writing code. Coding should be primarily done in pairs or together as a group, not solo, and good team skills are essential.

### Designers
Designers help the developer teams with the design of their software. UX and graphic design are very important parts of every successful application.
