The Student Developer Program operates in two main wings: software development, and teaching. Student positions are available in both departments. All student employees report to the Program Manager and Expert Developer, Casey Watts and Jemin Lee ([dev-mgt@yale.edu](mailto:dev-mgt@yale.edu)).

## Software Development
Development is split into teams, each comprised of three developers, a technical lead, and a project manager (i.e., five per team). There are four teams for Ruby on Rails, two for iOS, and two for Android development.

### Project Manager
The Project Manager in a team is primarily responsible for meeting with clients, determining and triaging clients' needs and concerns, and coordinating testing of new releases. The Project Manager is also responsible for communicating clients' needs to the rest of the team, and working with the Technical Lead to lead team meetings. The Project Manager should have a basic understanding of the team code in order to answer clients' questions on usage and work with the Technical Lead to provide realistic expectations for feature requests.

### Technical Lead
The Technical Lead is responsible for determining the feasibility of implementing changes, and coordinating work within the team. The Technical Lead should serve as the first point of technical reference for team members, when questions arise. The Technical Lead is also responsible for managing pull requests and keeping the code in a functional state, and (for Rails teams) will be trained how to deploy new instances of the application for new clients.

### Developers
Developers work under the Technical Lead and Project Manager and are responsible for writing code. Coding should be primarily done in pairs or together as a group, not solo, and good team skills are essential.

## Teaching
The Developer Program offers a Ruby on Rails training course, not-for-credit, each semester. Positions are available to make this happen.

### Relationship Coordinator
The Relationship Coordinator works with ITS, IdeaScale, HackYale, Y-Hack, NewHaven.io, and other companies and universities to organize collaborations for use of technology, training, etc., anywhere between NYC and Boston.

### Developer Training Coordinator
The Developer Training Coordinator is responsible for making sure we have appropriate support for training.

### Head Teaching Fellow
The Head Teaching Fellow coordinates course plans with the Program Manager and Expert Developer (dev-mgt), and works with the other teaching fellows to lead class each week.

### Teaching Fellows (four)
Four teaching fellows work with the Head TF to make each semester's course possible.

### Community Consultants (2 Mobile, 2 Web = 4 Total)
Community Consultants are experienced developers who:
* assist the developer teams with technical guidance;
* hold Office Hours (and/or Hacknights?) for the community;
* help Yale developer community members decide what technologies / packages to use to meet their needs; and
* help connect community members to the resources they need.

### Designers (four)
Designers help the developer teams with the design of their software. UX and graphic design are very important parts of every successful application.
